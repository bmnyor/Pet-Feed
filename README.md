# Pet-Feed
Project developed during the first semester of 2018
Created by a guy that loves his pets and is willing to fulfill their pets deepest desires. This irresponsible human being doesn't know how to feed his pets properly, Terra (one os his cats) ALWAYS have to meow to her human, trying to make him notice that her bowl is EMPTY she ! After some headaches, her human decided to create a way to know when her bowl is EMPTY or almost EMPTY.
